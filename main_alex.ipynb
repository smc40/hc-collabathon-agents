Hepatic Effects: In clinical trials, persistent increases in serum transaminases greater than three times the upper limit of normal occurred in <1% of patients who received atorvastatin calcium. When the dosage of atorvastatin calcium was reduced, or when drug treatment was interrupted or discontinued, serum transaminase levels returned to pretreatment levels. There have been rare post-marketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart ACH-ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM. ACH-ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM, as well as other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of ACH-ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM; if such a condition should develop during therapy, the drug should be discontinued.]\n",

In clinical trials, liver function tests showed abnormal results, including increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). There have been rare reports of hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice. The incidence of patients who experienced abnormally high enzymatic levels (AST/ALT) was > 4%. There have been rare post-marketing reports of severe liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurring during treatment with ACH-ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM.] \n",

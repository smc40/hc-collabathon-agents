Hepatic Effects: In clinical trials, persistent increases in serum transaminases greater than three times the upper limit of normal occurred in <1% of patients who received atorvastatin calcium. When the dosage of atorvastatin calcium was reduced, or when drug treatment was interrupted or discontinued, serum transaminase levels returned to pretreatment levels. There have been rare post-marketing reports of fatal and non-fatal hepatic failure in patients taking statins, including atorvastatin. If an alternate etiology is not found, do not restart ACH-ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM. ACH-ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM, as well as other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol and/or have a past history of liver disease. Active liver disease or unexplained transaminase elevations are contraindications to the use of ACH-ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM; if such a condition should develop during therapy, the drug should be discontinued.]\n",

      "#S2 [Adverse Reactions]:[The most serious adverse reactions associated with atorvastatin calcium were rhabdomyolysis, with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, myalgia, myositis, myopathy. In clinical trials, liver function tests showed abnormal results, including increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The incidence of patients who experienced abnormally high enzymatic levels (AST/ALT) was > 4%. There have been rare reports of hepatitis and cholestatic jaundice. If serious liver injury with clinical symptoms and/or hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice occurs during treatment with ACH-ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM, promptly interrupt therapy.] \n",

      "\n",
      "Atorvastatin is associated with Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) and can cause changes in liver function tests. This includes potential elevations in liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which are indicators of liver injury. It can lead to conditions like hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, and in serious cases, liver injury. It is important to monitor liver function while taking atorvastatin, especially if there are prior liver concerns or concurrent alcohol consumption.\n"
